# MemoBrain OS - Your Personal Memory Operating System

MemoBrain OS is a sophisticated personal memory management system that helps you organize, connect, and retrieve your digital memories in a way that mimics how your brain works. It's not just a file manager or note-taking app‚Äîit's a complete operating system for your memories.

## üåü Key Features

### üß† Memory Management
- **Semantic Search**: Find memories using natural language queries
- **Multimodal Support**: Store and search through text, images, PDFs, and more
- **Memory Importance**: Automatically or manually assign importance levels to memories
- **Memory Relationships**: Create and visualize connections between related memories
- **Temporal Organization**: View and filter memories chronologically

### üìä Dashboard
- Memory statistics and insights
- Importance distribution visualization
- Category distribution analysis
- Recent memories timeline
- Memory relationship graph
